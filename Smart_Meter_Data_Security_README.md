# Smart Meter Data Security Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a privacy-preserving billing protocol for smart meters, addressing the privacy concerns associated with detailed energy consumption data collected by smart meters. The project aims to revolutionize energy management by ensuring data security and user privacy.

## Project Description
The protocol integrates multiple cryptographic techniques to secure smart meter data:
- **Elliptic Curve (EC) ElGamal Encryption**: Used for secure data storage, transmission, and processing, ensuring confidentiality of energy consumption data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Specifically Bulletproofs**: Employed for filtering abnormal consumption data while maintaining privacy.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Equivalence (ZKPe)**: Ensures the integrity of the encrypted smart meter consumption data.

A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates the practical applicability of these cryptographic modules, focusing on encryption, decryption, and computational efficiency.
