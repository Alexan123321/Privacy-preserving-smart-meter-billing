# Smart Meter Data Security Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of a privacy-preserving billing protocol for smart meters, addressing the privacy concerns associated with detailed energy consumption data collected by smart meters.

## Project Description
The protocol integrates multiple cryptographic techniques to secure smart meter data:
- **Elliptic Curve (EC) ElGamal Encryption**: Used for secure data storage, transmission, and processing, ensuring confidentiality of energy consumption data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Specifically Bulletproofs**: Employed for filtering abnormal consumption data while maintaining privacy.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Equivalence (ZKPe)**: Ensures the integrity of the encrypted smart meter consumption data.
